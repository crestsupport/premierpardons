1. Introduction
1.1 What This Guide Covers
Starting a journey toward clearing your criminal record can be daunting, but it’s a crucial step toward rebuilding your life. This e-book, prepared by Premier Pardons, offers a comprehensive introduction to pardons and record suspensions in Canada, as well as U.S. entry waivers for individuals with a criminal history. Whether you’re looking to remove the barriers of a past conviction or gain the freedom to travel, this guide provides the foundational knowledge you need. We’ll explore eligibility, the application process, and key considerations to help you make informed decisions.

2. Pardons and Record Suspensions
2.1 Eligibility Criteria
In Canada, a record suspension (formerly called a pardon) allows individuals to have their criminal record kept separate and apart from other criminal records. To be eligible, you must meet the following criteria:
- You have completed all sentences, including jail time, probation, and paid all fines.
- A waiting period has passed: 10 years for indictable (felony) offenses, or 5 years for summary (misdemeanor) offenses, measured from the completion of your sentence.
- You have had no new convictions during the waiting period.
- You demonstrate good conduct, meaning no further involvement with law enforcement.
Certain offenses, such as those involving sexual offenses against minors, may render you ineligible under the Criminal Records Act.

2.2 The Application Process
Applying for a record suspension involves several steps:
- Obtain your criminal record and court information from the RCMP and local courts.
- Complete the necessary forms, including the Application for Record Suspension and Local Police Records Check.
- Pay the application fee (currently around $657 CAD, subject to change).
- Submit your application to the Parole Board of Canada (PBC), which reviews and decides on approvals.
Premier Pardons can assist with document preparation and submission to streamline this process. Processing times typically range from 6 months to a year, depending on case complexity.

3. U.S. Entry Waivers
3.1 Understanding U.S. Border Policies
A criminal record can prevent entry into the United States due to the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, which bars individuals with convictions for crimes of moral turpitude or other offenses. Even with a Canadian record suspension, U.S. authorities can still access your record via the CPIC database. A U.S. Entry Waiver (Form I-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter) is required to overcome this barrier, allowing temporary entry for work, travel, or family visits.

3.2 Applying for a Waiver
The waiver process includes:
- Completing Form I-192, available from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
- Providing detailed personal information, criminal history, and supporting documents (e.g., court records, character references).
- Paying the filing fee (approximately $930, plus biometrics, subject to change).
- Submitting the application to a U.S. consulate or USCIS, which may take 6-12 months for approval.
Premier Pardons can guide you through this process, ensuring all documentation meets U.S. requirements. Approval is not guaranteed and depends on the nature of the offense and your current circumstances.

4. Conclusion
4.1 Next Steps
Clearing your criminal record or securing a U.S. entry waiver is a significant step toward a brighter future.
