        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: June 18, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Premier Pardons ("we," "us," or "our"), a Canadian company providing pardon and record suspension services, is committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), Quebec’s Law 25, and other applicable Canadian privacy laws. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal information when you visit https://crestsupport.github.io/premierpardons/ or use our services.</p>

        <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
        <p>"Personal Information" includes any data that can identify you, such as name, address, contact details, criminal record information, and payment data. "Sensitive Personal Information" includes data related to your criminal history or health, which receives heightened protection under law.</p>

        <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect:
        - **Voluntarily Provided Information**: Name, contact details, criminal record details, and payment information you provide during service applications.
        - **Automatically Collected Information**: IP addresses, browser type, and visit timestamps via cookies and analytics tools.
        - **Third-Party Information**: Data from government agencies or legal partners, with your consent, for pardon processing.</p>

        <h2>4. Purposes of Collection</h2>
        <p>We use your information to:
        - Process and submit pardon or record suspension applications.
        - Communicate with you regarding service updates or legal requirements.
        - Ensure compliance with Canadian laws, including identity verification.
        - Improve our services through aggregated, anonymized analytics.
        Changes to purpose require your explicit consent unless legally mandated.</p>

        <h2>5. Consent and Withdrawal</h2>
        <p>We obtain your consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information, except where permitted by law (e.g., legal obligation). Consent can be explicit (e.g., signed form) or implied (e.g., continued use after notice), with heightened requirements for sensitive data under Law 25. You may withdraw consent at any time by contacting us, though this may affect service delivery.</p>

        <h2>6. Disclosure of Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. Disclosure occurs only to:
        - Service providers (e.g., payment processors, legal consultants) under confidentiality agreements.
        - Government agencies for pardon processing, as required by law.
        - Third parties with your consent or as mandated (e.g., court orders).
        Cross-border transfers (e.g., to U.S. cloud providers) occur with safeguards like standard contractual clauses, and you will be notified.</p>

        <h2>7. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We implement encryption (e.g., SSL), access controls, regular security audits, and staff training to protect your information. Despite these measures, no system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee protection against all breaches. In case of a breach, we will notify affected individuals and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner within 72 hours as required by Law 25.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:
        - Access and receive a copy of your personal information.
        - Request correction of inaccurate data.
        - Object to certain uses or request deletion, subject to legal restrictions.
        - Withdraw consent or file complaints with the Privacy Commissioner.
        Quebec residents have additional rights under Law 25, including data portability and protection from automated decision-making. Contact us at info@premierpardons.ca to exercise these rights.</p>

        <h2>9. Retention and Disposal</h2>
        <p>We retain your information for the duration necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined or as required by law (e.g., 5 years post-application under the Criminal Records Act). Data is securely destroyed using shredding or digital wiping methods to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

        <h2>10. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>We use cookies for functionality and analytics. You can manage preferences via your browser settings. Our use complies with PIPEDA, and we provide a cookie consent notice on the Site. Third-party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) may be used, with data anonymized where possible.</p>

        <h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our services are not directed at individuals under 19. We do not knowingly collect data from minors and will delete such information upon discovery.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Policy, with changes posted here and a revised "Last Updated" date. Material changes will be notified via email or a prominent Site notice. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.</p>

        <h2>13. Contact and Complaints</h2>
