        <p>Last Updated: June 18, 2025</p>

        <p>Premier Pardons ("we," "us," or "our"), a Canadian company specializing in pardon and record suspension services, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information in compliance with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and Quebecâ€™s Law 25.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect personal information such as your name, contact details, criminal record details, and payment information when you use our services or visit our Site. We also collect non-personal information, such as IP addresses and browsing data, through cookies and analytics tools.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your information is used to process pardon applications, communicate with you, improve our services, and comply with legal obligations. We may use aggregated, anonymized data for statistical purposes without identifying individuals.</p>

        <h2>4. Disclosure of Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share it with service providers (e.g., payment processors) or government agencies as required for pardon processing, with appropriate safeguards. Disclosure outside Canada occurs only with your consent or as mandated by law, subject to adequate protection measures.</p>

        <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We implement encryption, access controls, and regular audits to protect your information. However, no method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security against all risks.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information, subject to legal restrictions. To exercise these rights, contact us at info@premierpardons.ca. Residents of Quebec have additional rights under Law 25, including the right to data portability.</p>

        <h2>7. Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your information only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined or as required by law, after which it is securely destroyed.</p>

        <h2>8. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>We use cookies to enhance your experience. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings. Our use of analytics tools complies with Canadian privacy standards.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. Changes will be posted here with an updated "Last Updated" date. We will notify you of material changes via email or a prominent notice on the Site.</p>
